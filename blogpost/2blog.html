The idea of this post comes from this <a href="https://twitter.com/AlasdairRoberts/status/1736561832855319015", target="_blank">tweet</a> published by Alasdair Roberts,
in which he tries to address the lack of Global South representation in one of the most important journals in the field (according to the ABS ranking the most important).
Indeed, according to his result, developing countries represent just the 1,6 % of the total publications in PAR, while the Denmark accounts for the <strong>3, 4 %</strong> which,
even taking into consideration the pivotal role of Danish scholars within the PA field, is quite surprising.<br>
These results triggered my willingness of see things clearly and try to understand if this is an isolated situation or there is actually not only a problem of global
representation but actually a misbalance towards specific nations.
