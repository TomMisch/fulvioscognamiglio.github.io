 <h4>General info</h4>

<p>
  This is the first post of my blog, which I believe is the most complicated, like when you shake hands for the first time and forget the other person's name. 
  However, I would like to give a try (I don't have any other option I guess). <br>
  I don't want to annoy you with my bio (you can find it <a href="/index.html#bio">here</a>). In this post, I want to give you a sense of the kind of stuff you will read here. <br>
  Mostly academic-related posts. I'm a scholar, what did you expect? Most of my time is spent researching, reading, writing, and teaching. Also, I feel this is part 
  of who I am and not just a job from which to escape. I would like for this section to have two different aims. The first is to test ideas, theories, and analysis before
  thinking of transforming into a more concrete project. A sort of ongoing presentation (and indeed, I'll also implement a comment section). For the most part, 
  you'll find posts about governance, wickedness, social innovation, and science of science (boring systematic literature review and bibliometric considerations). <br>
  The second aim is to keep a miscellanea diary, where I could talk about stuff I'm reading, considerations about the field, future projects or conferences. 
  I do expect people to comment also on this other stuff ( and probably they would be the most popular posts, being the content more provocative for sure)
